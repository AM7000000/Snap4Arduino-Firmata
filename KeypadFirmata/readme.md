#KeypadFirmata
A library that allows Snap4Arduino to interface with a 4x4 keypad.
##Instructions
1. Install the 'Keypad' library to your Arduino ide. The library can be found in the 'Libraries' folder and more instructions about how to add a library to the Arduino ide can be found here: https://www.arduino.cc/en/guide/libraries.
2. Push the KeypadFirmata.ino sketch into your Arduino board by using the Arduino IDE.
3. Import the block library into Snap4Arduino by clicking on the file menu and selecting "Import...", then choosing the Keypad_blocks.xml file.
4. Follow the wiring diagram below to connect the buzzer. Note that the pin the buzzer is connected to on the Arduino is not important as this is specified from within Snap4Arduino.
